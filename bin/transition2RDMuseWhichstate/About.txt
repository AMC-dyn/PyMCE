for imac 2021 using gfortran 10 then have to have USE mpi not mpi.h or will get an error for mpi broadcast

test on Ne 6-31G* to get working

note orbital symmetry labels will change if using pySCF instead of Molpro output

now modifying to read in ieig civ_in files and give the transition 2RDMs -- note must have sa_mcci=.true.
and use_sds=.true.  also gives standard 2RDM for last state  can change flag at start of mcci.f90 if this is unwanted


check states that have come from CSF -> SDs are orthonormal


Works and agrees 1 TRDM from 2TRDM agrees with direct calculation of 1TRDM. So comment out 1TRDM parts as don't need them now
